Whoa. Just walked out from Squad 36. Seriously, my head's still spinning like that dentist chair with a mind of its own. You know the one I mean, right? The squeaky, relentless annoying one. Anyway, the movie.

First off, flashing lights everywhere, like a disco ball exploded and tried to tell a story. Explosions, way too many, honestly. Think popcorn popping but with more bass. Speaking of—popcorn crumbs all over my shirt, don’t ask how.

> So this guy, what was his name? Victor? Vincent? Voice like sandpaper and thunder all mixed in. He had that one scene—remember?—when he looked out over the burning city and it was epic. Or silly. I can’t decide. Can you? Anyway, something about his eyebrows reminded me of those angry cats you always see online. Shiny posters, grumbly faces, chaos—I mean, I could almost smell the chaos through the screen.

What was with the sound at the start? Like being trapped inside a washing machine with a drum set. But Julia’s character? A classic case of heart hidden in her sleeve, like my aching back right now. True grit, wrapped in sass and a jacket with too many zippers. Hah, that scene where they hacked the traffic lights? Deliciously random, like my browsing history.

The guys behind me were coughing up a storm—popcorn or pneumonia? You never know. But darn, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I should've just download the movie, you know? More comfy back home. Someone told me I’d want to re-watch the movie but ehhh, jury’s out on that one. It's kinda like flossing—good in theory, but hard to commit.

Oh, there was this one montage scene with killer techno music (literally, criminals danced and hit people, whoa), where I actually felt my heart syncing with that chaotic rhythm. I should have paid more attention but was a bit distracted by finding popcorn fragments in my sock. The sticky floors! Like glue traps for humans.

Reminded me of this one time when I had to extract a tooth and things went sideways—totally unrelated but equally unexpected.

```
def forgot_what_i_was_saying():
    if popcorn == chaos:
        return movie_flashbacks
    else:
        return need_coffee
```

Time to rest. Or floss. Or whatever.
